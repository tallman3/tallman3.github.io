                <h2>Challenging Times</h2>
                <p>
                    For several decades, many Canadians have used Canada Premium Bonds (CPBs) and Canada Savings Bonds
                    (CSBs) to
                    generate income during retirement with a low risk profile.
                    Unfortunately in the current low-interest environment, it is no longer a viable retirement plan.
                    Although
                    the Canadian stock market, as represented by the TSE index, has been volatile
                    and lost almost 35% in one year during the 2008 recession, older investors would be far better off
                    today if
                    they had invested in the stock market rather than government bonds.

            <p><strong>There is no broad consensus in Canada on the true measurement of a Savings or Investment rate.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In this analysis, the Canadian Premium Bonds (CPBs) savings rate are used to represent savings.  CPBs are widely available
                    to most Canadians with a competitive interest rate. </li>
                <li>The Toronto Stock Exchange index (TSE) will be used to represent a return on investment.  The TSE represents
                    the majority of Canadian public companies and is a good representative for typical Canadian investors.
                </li>
                <li>Canada's inflation is measured the the Consumer Price Index (CPI)</li>
